- automatically fetch rate when both sides of currency and source amount provided
- handle FX rate API response in different states (demo API is provided below)
- calculate and display the markup rate (1% markup) and fee using the following formula:

- when the source amount changes, recalculate the target amount
- click the icon in the middle to switch 2 currencies and re-fetch the rate
- click the "Submit" button to save the conversion data to the database

#### Bonus:
- make both amounts can be changed (automatically re-calculate another amount)
- if the target amount is provided, the fee is calculated using this formula:

### üìÑ Transactions page:

- display this transaction record component:

- fetch data from the database and populate the table


## üéØ Requirements:

- use TypeScript
- use React
- use any relational database
- use any Node.js framework to create API
- please utilize the backend to calculate the rate or fee. The frontend's role is solely to provide the symbol and amount.
- use this API to retrieve currency rates: https://openexchangerates.org/ (Note: This API provides rates with USD as the base currency, e.g., USD -> AUD. It does not allow changing the base currency. Therefore, you need to devise a solution using the available data to calculate the desired conversion rate.)
- keep the component as close to the design as possible (blue1:`#33428E`, blue2: `#012754`, button:`#002854`, background: `#F8F9FB`) (please find icons in assets folder)
- use docker to containerize the app

### ‚≠êBonus:

- use MUI, Styled-components or Emotion
- use Nest.js to create your API
- use an ORM for database manipulation
- write a couple of tests
